# Recognization-Of-Pneumonia-Chest-X-Ray-Using-CNN
This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify chest X-rays as normal or pneumonia-affected, achieving 97.94% accuracy. The model is trained on 4,538 images, with data preprocessing and hyperparameter tuning. Key performance metrics are evaluated, demonstrating deep learning's potential in medical diagnostics.
