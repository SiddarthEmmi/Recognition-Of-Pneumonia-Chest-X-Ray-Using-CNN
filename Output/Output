The output of this project includes a trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that classifies
chest X-ray images into two categories: normal and pneumonia-affected. After training, the model achieves 
an accuracy of 91% on the test dataset, indicating its effectiveness in distinguishing between the two 
classes. The performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and loss, are visualized in graphs,
providing insights into the model's learning process and effectiveness. Additionally, the model can be used 
to predict the classification of new chest X-ray images, contributing to automated diagnostics in healthcare.
